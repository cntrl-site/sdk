# Post ONE combined AI review per run.
#
# The review BODY is a per-run status table plus a collapsed-by-default
# <details> block per agent carrying that agent's non-line-specific notes
# (its `summary`). Every line-anchored finding is attached as an inline comment
# on this single review, so the table comment is the primary review that all
# inline comments hang off of.
#
# A fresh review is posted on every run (not edited in place). A hidden
# per-agent reviewed-sha marker in the body lets the next run resume
# incremental review.
#
# Today there is a single agent (quality / thermo-nuclear). The structure is
# deliberately kept multi-agent-shaped: to add another agent, give it a job
# that uploads a findings artifact, pass its QUAL_*-style env block here, then
# add one `collect_comments` call (merged into ALL_COMMENTS), one table row,
# one `emit_notes` call, and one hidden reviewed-sha marker below.
#
# Inputs (env):
#   REPO, PR, GH_TOKEN
#   SUMMARY_MARKER  - hidden marker identifying our review bodies
#   REVIEW_MODEL    - model name shown in the table
#   RUN_URL         - link to this workflow run (optional)
#   HEAD_SHA        - commit the review (and its inline comments) is anchored to
#   Quality agent (QUAL_*):
#     QUAL_STATUS        - clean | findings | skipped | failed | "" (job skipped)
#     QUAL_FINDINGS      - line-anchored findings count
#     QUAL_RECORD_SHA    - sha to persist as this agent's reviewed-sha
#     QUAL_TURNS, QUAL_COST, QUAL_DURATION - run metadata
#     QUAL_MARKER        - hidden per-agent marker appended to each inline body
#     QUAL_FINDINGS_FILE - path to the agent's findings JSON (may be absent)
#                          schema: { "summary": "<md>", "comments": [{path, line, body}, ...] }
#
# Posts one PR review (event=COMMENT): body = table + per-agent notes + markers,
# comments[] = every line-anchored finding (each suffixed with its agent
# marker). If the batched review is rejected (e.g. a comment targets a line
# outside the PR diff), it falls back to posting the body-only review plus each
# inline comment individually, skipping the ones GitHub rejects.
